# Tools to bootstrap micro computers

Bootstrapping a micro computer can be tedious. This repository contains 2
tools to help with that specifically:

- `flash.py`: Downloads an image, flashes it to an SD card and modifies it to
  run `setup.sh` upon the first boot.
- `setup.sh`: script to run on an already flashed device. Subset of its
  functionality is extracted:
  - `rename_host.sh` to rename the host leveraging the serial number of the
    device.
  - `install_go.sh` to install the Go toolchain.

These were written to help manage the [gohci](https://github.com/periph/gohci)
workers, so they can be reflashed easily in case of tampering but the script are
intentionally generic and reusable.



## Flashing a new device

This downloads the Raspbian Jessie Lite image and flashes it to an SD Card.  You
must supply the path to the SD card, generally in the form of `/dev/sdX` or
`/dev/mmcblkN`. This only works on linux for now.

```
./flash.py -distro raspbian --wifi <ssid> <pwd> /dev/sdh
```

## Setuping a device

If you already have a running device and want to run setup on it, use:
```
curl -sSL https://goo.gl/JcTSsH | bash
```

or a subset:

### Installing Go

```
curl -sSL https://goo.gl/TFmVMG | bash
```

### Renaming host

This renames the host to `<board>-<id>` where `<board>` is one of `beaglebone`,
`chip`, `odroid` or `raspberrypi` and `<id>` is calculated from either the CPU
serial number or systemd's hostctl 'Machine ID'.

```
curl -sSL https://goo.gl/EkANh0 | bash
```


## Modifications

- Update the hostname to be `$BOARD-$SERIAL[:4]` where the board is the detected
  board and the serial number is gathered from the CPU, failing that from
  systemctl.
- `/etc/motd` is updated to be `Welcome to $HOST`.
- `apt update` & `apt upgrade` are run.
- `$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys` (or a public key failing that) is copied in the
  home directory of the device.
- Password based ssh is disabled.
- Setup wpa_supplicant when applicable.
- ODROID
  - Root ssh is disabled.
- Raspbian
  - IÂ²C, SPI are enabled.
  - Keyboard layout is set to en_US.
  - Country (for wifi) is set to Canada.
  - ntpdate is installed.
- Go toolchain is installed in `/usr/local/go`.
- `/etc/profile.d/golang.sh` is added to set `$PATH` and `$GOPATH`.
