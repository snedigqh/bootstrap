# Tools to bootstrap micro computers

Bootstrapping a micro computer can be tedious. This repository contains 2
tools to help with that specifically:

- `flash.py`: Downloads an image, flashes it to an SD card and modifies it to
  run `setup.sh` upon the first boot.
- `setup.sh`: script to run on an already flashed device.

These were written to help manage the [gohci](https://github.com/periph/gohci)
workers, so they can be reflashed easily in case of tampering but the script are
intentionally generic and reusable.

This is a work in progress.
